# Generative AI Developement

## Generative Engineering (GenEng)

GenEng revolution being led by developers who build deep proficiency in how to best leverage and integrate generative AI technologies into applications

There is a clear separation of roles between those that create and train models (Data Scientists and Engineers) and those who use those models (Developers). This was already on the way, and it much clearer with the GenAI revolution - the future of the GenAI will be determined on how it will be driven to adoption - and it will be driven by how developers adopt it.

GenEng practitioners will need to have many of the same skills of traditional application development, including scalable architecting, integrating enterprise systems, and understanding requirements from the business user. These skills will be augmented with the nuances of building generative AI applications, such as involving the business domain experts in validating aspects of prompt engineering and choosing the right LLM based on price/performance and outcomes
